# SEPpy

A compendium of python data loaders for in-situ measurements of Solar Energetic Particles (SEP)

So far combines the following loaders into one PyPI package:

- [psp-isois-loader](https://github.com/jgieseler/psp-isois-loader)
- [soho-loader](https://github.com/jgieseler/soho-loader)
- [solo-epd-loader](https://github.com/jgieseler/solo-epd-loader)*
- [stereo-loader](https://github.com/jgieseler/stereo-loader)
- [wind-3dp-loader](https://github.com/jgieseler/wind-3dp-loader)

*Note that [solo-epd-loader](https://github.com/jgieseler/solo-epd-loader) is a [PyPI package itself](https://pypi.org/project/solo-epd-loader/) that just is loaded here for completeness.
